**You:**

w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(movies)
what this code is doing actually. expalin me in very basic simple terms. what is the use of dot and why we are using it. is w getting the data from newencoder or is it sending to newencoder

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

This code snippet is likely part of a Go programming language (Golang) web server implementation. Let's break it down step by step:

w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json"): This line is used to set the "Content-Type" header of the HTTP response to indicate that the response body will be in JSON format. The w variable represents the HTTP response writer, which is used to send the response back to the client

json.NewEncoder(w): This creates a new JSON encoder that will encode data and write it to the response writer (w). The encoder is a tool provided by the Go standard library for encoding Go data structures into JSON format

Encode(movies): This line encodes the movies variable (presumably a collection of movie data) into JSON format using the JSON encoder created in the previous step. The resulting JSON data is then written to the response writer (w), which will send it back to the client as part of the HTTP response


The dot notation (`.`) in `w.Header()` and `json.NewEncoder(w)` is used to access the methods and properties of an object (`w` in this case). It allows you to call methods or set properties on the object represented by the variable (`w`) using the dot notation.
To summarize, this code sets the "Content-Type" header of the HTTP response to JSON, creates a JSON encoder that will write the encoded movie data to the response writer, and then encodes the movie data into JSON format and sends it back to the client.
